# Automation Testing Project: Virtual Showroom 2
Selenium, TestNG, ExtentReport Automation Testing Framework
This framework is build in eclipse, it is a maven project. It uses Selenium, TestNG and ExtentReport so that we can create testcases that run automatically, even in parallel execution. And we get a clearly arranged report of all tests that were executed.
For improved test case maintenance and reduced code duplication the page object model design pattern is implemented.
